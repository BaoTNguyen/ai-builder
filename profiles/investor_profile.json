      "description": "Knows to sell exactly 2 contracts to match a 200-share holding and targets the $190 strike aligned with the desired exit price \u2014 demonstrates practical covered call sizing, contract-to-share ratio awareness, and income-vs-exit goal alignment."

      "concept_label": "Time Decay (Theta): How options lose value over time",
      "description": "Correctly attributes the erosion of option value near expiration to Theta (time decay) rather than Delta or volatility changes \u2014 shows awareness that time itself is a built-in cost when holding long options, critical for trade timing decisions."

Treats the covered call as if it simply expires worthlessly regardless of where the stock trades. Misses the core obligation: when the short call is ITM at expiry, the seller is expected to deliver shares at the strike price \u2014 keeping both the stock and premium is not an option.",

      "misconception": "Treats multiple ITM options expiring simultaneously as passive, self-resolving events. Underestimates the compounding assignment risk, potential capital requirement, and portfolio-level disruption of allowing 5 concurrent ITM positions to expire without active review or decision-making on each.",

High Gamma means that Delta is rapidly changing and even small moves in the underlying can cause large, accelerating swings in option value \u2014 making the portfolio more sensitive and unstable, not protected.
