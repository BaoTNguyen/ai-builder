    "delta_summary": "The portfolio is strongly net long delta \u2014 approximately $200k of long equity exposure. Covered calls on 6 positions slightly reduce effective delta by capping upside on those names (equivalent to being short a small amount of delta on each). Protective puts on SPY, QQQ, NVDA, and TSLA add negative delta hedges worth roughly $65k notional at 10% OTM, cushioning the portfolio by approximately $6,500 in put payoff per $10 drop in those anchors. Net delta remains robustly positive: the portfolio still gains meaningfully as markets rise, but has a structured floor on the downside.",
    "theta_summary": "Time decay is a net positive for this overlay. The 14 covered call contracts generate approximately +$41/day in positive theta (time decay earns money as expiry approaches). The 4 protective puts consume approximately \u2212$17/day in negative theta (cost of insurance erodes daily). Net theta is approximately +$24/day \u2014 meaning the options overlay earns roughly $720/month from time passage alone, independent of market direction. This is the core engine of the income strategy.",
    "vega_summary": "The portfolio is modestly net short vega. Covered calls sold on 6 positions create short vega exposure \u2014 if implied volatility rises sharply, those calls become more expensive to buy back (temporary paper loss). However, the 4 protective puts held are long vega \u2014 they increase in value when volatility spikes, partially offsetting the short-vega risk from covered calls. Net effect: the portfolio performs best in stable-to-moderately-volatile environments (CC premiums are captured cleanly) and is partially self-hedged against volatility explosions via the protective put positions."
